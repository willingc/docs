# docs
Because we like people to be able to read things and docs enable more people to get involved and using the project.

## Welcome
Hi!

Thanks for visiting our documentation. We strive to provide helpful and
clear instructions, tips, and inspiration when using the nteract projects. If
you see anything that we could do better, please let us know and create an
issue by clicking the "New Issue" button on the
[Issues page](https://github.com/nteract/docs/issues),

## Documentation contents
We're in the early stages of creating documentation. Here are links to our
documentation:
